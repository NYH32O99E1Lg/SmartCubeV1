# SmartCube

**SmartCube** is a tiny and customizable desk toy using the ESP8266 D1 Mini.
Built entirely from cheap, easy-to-find parts, it can connect to Wi-Fi and can be programmed to do just about anything:
show notifications, display the weather, monitor stuff, show a clock, serve a web site, be a virtual pet or whatever else your caffeine-fueled brain can imagine.

## Info    
- **This is a hobby project I work on and develop for when I have literally nothing else to do, do not expect regular updates. You are free to clone this and do whatever you like with it**
- **Code**: I have a few projects developed for the Cube. You can see the list [here on my Gitea](https://git.kopic.hr/tomislav?tab=repositories&q=cube&sort=recentupdate) 
- **V2**: There is also a more [powerful version](https://git.kopic.hr/tomislav/SmartCubeV2), it's pretty much the same but with extra features and is using ESP32, I only made one of them and I don't like it yet, it needs work. 
- **Case**: 3D-printable design included in `/hardware` directory  
- **Schematics**: and assembly instructions are also in the `/hardware` directory

## Demo Code Explanation

This repository contains a basic "Hello, World!" project for the SmartCube.

### Getting Started:

1. Download and install **[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** or **[VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)**.
2. Install the **[PlatformIO IDE extension](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide)**.
3. Clone this repository and open the project folder in VSCode/VSCodium.
4. PlatformIO will automatically handle environment setup and dependencies when you open the project.

### Project Structure:

All source code is located in the `src/` directory.
You should start by opening **`src/main.cpp`**, which contains the entry point and initialization logic.

### What the Code Does:

This demo handles basic system functionality, including:

* System initialization
* Button input handling
* OLED display output configuration
* WiFi management

### Key Features  

1. **WiFi Management**:  
   - The [cubeWifiManager](https://git.kopic.hr/tomislav/SmartCubeV1/src/branch/main/src/SmartCube/cubeWifiManager.h) class manages WiFi connectivity seamlessly.  
   - If no known WiFi network is available, it starts a configuration portal and creates an access point (AP), allowing users to connect the SmartCube to a network from another WiFi-enabled device.  
   - The OLED display shows the access point details, such as the AP name and IP address, making the setup process very easy.

2. **Button Handling**:  
   - Buttons are mapped to specific GPIO pins: `PIN_BTN_L` (Left), `PIN_BTN_M` (Middle), and `PIN_BTN_R` (Right).  
   - The [cubeButtonHandler](https://git.kopic.hr/tomislav/SmartCubeV1/src/branch/main/src/SmartCube/cubeButtons.h) function, executed in the [loop()](https://git.kopic.hr/tomislav/SmartCubeV1/src/commit/1cb51f502d92a91c6a83ce6364b434db31bfd864/src/main.cpp#L47), monitors and interprets button presses, differentiating between short and long presses.  

#### Default Button Actions  
- **Right Button**:  
  - *Short Press*: Turns the OLED display **on** (if previously off).  
  - *Long Press*: Turns the OLED display **off**, helping conserve power.  

- **Left + Middle Buttons (Simultaneous Long Press)**:  
  - Triggers an ESP8266 reboot, effectively restarting the device.  

This is meant to provide a minimal starting point for further development with the SmartCube.

## Pin Connections  

Pin numbers for buttons and other stuff is defined in the [example config](https://git.kopic.hr/tomislav/SmartCubeV1/src/branch/main/src/example_config.h) and the schematic for the [D1 Mini is here](https://git.kopic.hr/tomislav/SmartCubeV1/raw/branch/main/hardware/schematics/esp8266.png):  
You don't have to follow my pin definition exactly but i find this the easiest way to assemble and fit everything in.
- Button Left (PIN_BTN_L): GPIO12  
- Button Middle (PIN_BTN_M): GPIO13  
- Button Right (PIN_BTN_R): GPIO15  
- Piezo Buzzer (PIN_BUZZER): GPIO0  

The OLED display must to be connected via I2C on pins:
- **SDA**: D2 (GPIO4)  
- **SCL**: D1 (GPIO5)

## Assembly Instructions  

1. **Power Supply Setup**:  
   - Solder the 14250 battery to the TP4056 module input pins.  
   - Wire the output of the TP4056 to the **3.3V pin** on the D1 Mini to power the device.  
   - Connect the **5V output pin** from the D1 Mini to the **input port** on the TP4056 module to allow charging trough the Data USB port on the ESP8266.  
![Battery](https://git.kopic.hr/tomislav/SmartCubeV1/raw/branch/main/hardware/pictures/IMG_20241130_171550.jpg)


2. **OLED Display**: Solder connections for SDA (D2, GPIO4) and SCL (D1, GPIO5) to the respective pins on the D1 Mini.  
3. **Buttons**: Attach each button to the specified GPIO pins with pull-down resistors to ensure reliable input.  
4. **Buzzer**: Connect the piezo buzzer, negative to the GPI00, positive to 3.3v
5. **Enclosure**: Assemble all components in a secure housing. May require some hot glue to keep components in

## Notes  

- This is still a work in progress
- Everything is pretty tightly packed in there and it's a mess. But it's not as hard to make as it looks.
![Packed](https://git.kopic.hr/tomislav/SmartCubeV1/raw/branch/main/hardware/pictures/IMG_20241213_171725.jpg)

- Ensure all connections are secure. Hot glue is your friend.
- Test the circuit thoroughly before placing and glueing it in the enclosure.  
- Battery is the trickiest part to fit in, it's best to glue the charging module directly to it and put it in the case last
