## Pin Connections  

### OLED Display Settings  
```c  
#define SCREEN_WIDTH 128  
#define SCREEN_HEIGHT 64  
#define OLED_RESET -1  
#define FRAMERATE 8  
```  
The OLED display is connected via I2C to the D1 Mini:  
- **SDA**: D2 (GPIO4)  
- **SCL**: D1 (GPIO5)  

### Buttons and Buzzer  
```c  
#define PIN_BTN_L 12 // D6  
#define PIN_BTN_M 13 // D7  
#define PIN_BTN_R 15 // D8  
#define PIN_BUZZER 0 // D3  
```  
- Button Left (PIN_BTN_L): GPIO12  
- Button Middle (PIN_BTN_M): GPIO13  
- Button Right (PIN_BTN_R): GPIO15  
- Piezo Buzzer (PIN_BUZZER): GPIO0

## Assembly Instructions  

1. **Power Supply Setup**:  
   - Connect the 14250 battery to the TP4056 module for safe charging and protection.  
   - Wire the output of the TP4056 to the **3.3V pin** on the D1 Mini to power the device.  
   - Connect the **5V output pin** from the D1 Mini to the **input port** on the TP4056 module to enable charging functionality.  

2. **OLED Display**: Solder connections for SDA (D2, GPIO4) and SCL (D1, GPIO5) to the respective pins on the D1 Mini.  
3. **Buttons**: Attach each button to the specified GPIO pins with pull-down resistors to ensure reliable input.  
4. **Buzzer**: Connect the piezo buzzer to GPIO0. Ensure proper polarity. Negative to the GPI00, Positive to 3.3v
5. **Enclosure (Optional)**: Assemble all components in a secure housing.

## Demo Code Explanation  

The provided demo code demonstrates the main features of the SmartCube, focusing on system initialization, button handling, OLED display output, and WiFi management. Below is a breakdown of its components:

### Key Features  

1. **WiFi Management**:  
   - The `cubeWifiManager` class manages WiFi connectivity seamlessly.  
   - If no known WiFi network is available, it starts a configuration portal and creates an access point (AP), allowing users to connect the SmartCube to a network from another WiFi-enabled device.  
   - The OLED display shows the access point details, such as the AP name and IP address, making the setup process user-friendly and accessible.

2. **Button Handling**:  
   - Buttons are mapped to specific GPIO pins: `PIN_BTN_L` (Left), `PIN_BTN_M` (Middle), and `PIN_BTN_R` (Right).  
   - The `cubeButtonHandler()` function, executed in the `loop()`, monitors and interprets button presses, differentiating between short and long presses.  

#### Default Button Actions  
- **Right Button**:  
  - *Short Press*: Turns the OLED display **on** (if previously off).  
  - *Long Press*: Turns the OLED display **off**, helping conserve power.  

- **Left + Middle Buttons (Simultaneous Long Press)**:  
  - Triggers an ESP8266 reboot, effectively restarting the device.
